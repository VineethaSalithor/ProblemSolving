# Guidelines for Problem Solving

## Setting up
- Students to register in http://codeforces.com if they don't have one.
- Other problem solving sites include http://spoj.com, http://projecteuler.net, http://codechef.com, http://leetcode.com.
- Students to register in http://stopstalk.com. This pools in the data from all online judges and provides a dashboard view.
- Advisors/Counselors to get the students' handles from all the above sites.


## Tracking Students
- Concatenation of profile link + handle allows you to see the details of a person. 
- For example, the following links show the (i) overall problems solved status and (ii) codeforces contests performance status of Mayank.
    (i) https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/katana_handler 
    (ii) https://codeforces.com/profile/katana_handler
- For convenience, one can setup a page or document or draft email with links to students under your advisor/consellorship. This way, you can readily click and track their progress everyday. 
  - For example, check the setup at https://www.amrita.ac.in/swaminathanj/ track the code@amrita students.

## Daily routine
- Pick 2-3 problems from codeforces or any other online judges and post in the class group before 8 or 9 am. (For S2 - C Programming faculty, S4 - Algorithms faculty, S6 - Compiler/Networks faculty)
- If by any chance, a student has already solved these problems, they can choose any other problem.
- Fix a discussion session in the afternoon (say 3-4 or at your convenience) and provide hints/pointers for students struggling. Code@amrita students can help. It is expected, students will submit by 8 pm or so.
- For the students who are already into CP, you can ask them to pick tougher problems. Only a handful of students expected in this category from each class. Sometimes they may not be able to get acceptance because the problems may be hard. This is fine as long as they try.
- The following code@amrita students can help in problem discussion.
    - S2CSE A - Hrishikesh, Hari Subramanian, Aswarth, Jaideep
    - S2CSE B - Anand K S, Aparna Dev, Bharat prathap
    - S2CSE C - 
    - S2CSE D - Sai Keerthan
    - S4CSE A - Sai Ruthwik (Amit Raja from Vipin sir's group)
    - S4CSE B - Deepak Naik (Subhash Reddy from Vipin sir's group)
    - S4CSE C - Saran S
    - S4CSE D - Ashish, Chamanth
    - S6CSE A - None (Manoj, Satwik can help)
    - S6CSE B - None (Sreejith can help)
    - S6CSE C - Nandakishore
    - S6CSE D - Aswanth, Rajendran, Manoj, Sanjay, Ganga, Drishti
- Advisors/Counselors can keep track of the respective students.
- Important Note: Each one should stick to their role strictly. 
    - Course faculty - Posting problems
    - Advisor/Counselor - Tracking students and following up
    - Student helpers - Problem discussion
    - Please don't use Student helpers beyond problem discussion. Such as posting problems or tracking students. It will dilute the seriousness. May be they can pick the problem, but faculty has to post and frontend.
